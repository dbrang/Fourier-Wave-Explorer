Fourier Wave Explorer

An interactive web tool that allows you to generate and analyze waveforms using Fourier analysis. This version lets you generate a composite waveform by summing five sine waves (with configurable frequencies and amplitudes) over a 1‑second interval. The tool then computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the composite signal and displays both the Fourier reconstruction (scaled to –1 to 1) and the power spectral density (PSD). It is inspired by code from: https://github.com/Jezzamonn/fourier

Features
	•	Composite Wave Generator:
Specify the frequency and amplitude for five sine waves using the input controls. When you click the “Generate Composite Wave” button, a composite 1‑second signal is created from the sum of these sine waves.
	•	Fourier Reconstruction:
The DFT of the composite waveform is calculated, and the reconstruction is displayed by summing a configurable number of sine components. The reconstruction is scaled so that its vertical range is exactly –1 to 1.
	•	Power Spectrum (PSD):
View the frequency content of the composite waveform, with a focus on the 0–30 Hz range.
	•	Clipped & Scaled Display:
The drawing, reconstruction, and PSD panels use consistent margins, padding, and clipping to ensure that signals are displayed neatly within the defined plot regions.

How It Works
	1.	Composite Wave Generation:
The composite signal is generated by summing five sine waves (each sampled at 1000 points over 1 second) based on user-defined frequency and amplitude values. The resulting waveform is mean-centered.
	2.	Fourier Transform:
The tool computes the DFT of the composite waveform. The reconstruction is formed by summing the first n sine components (with n adjustable via a slider).
	3.	Scaling:
Both the individual sine components (displayed in light blue) and the summed reconstruction (displayed in dark blue) are scaled using the same factor so that the reconstruction spans from –1 to 1.
	4.	Visualization:
	•	Composite Wave Panel: Displays the composite waveform.
	•	Fourier Reconstruction Panel: Displays the individual sine components and the overall reconstruction.
	•	PSD Panel: Displays the power distribution across frequency bins (0–30 Hz).

Installation
	1.	Clone or Download:
Clone this repository or download the index.html file.
	2.	Open in a Browser:
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge). No additional setup is needed.

Usage
	1.	Set Sine Wave Parameters:
Use the provided input fields to set the frequency (in Hz) and amplitude for each of the five sine waves.
	2.	Generate Composite Wave:
Click the “Generate Composite Wave” button to create the composite signal.
	3.	Adjust Reconstruction:
Use the slider to adjust the number of sine components used in the Fourier reconstruction.
	4.	View PSD:
The power spectrum panel displays the amplitude distribution for frequencies between 0 and 30 Hz.

Customization
	•	Parameters:
You can adjust constants such as the number of samples (N), duration (T), and plot margins/padding directly in the source code.
	•	Template Modifications:
The source includes template functions for generating different types of waves (square, white noise, pink noise, triangle, etc.) that you can modify or extend.

Dependencies
	•	p5.js 1.4.0 – A JavaScript library for creative coding.
